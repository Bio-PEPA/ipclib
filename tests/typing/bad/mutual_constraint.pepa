% This model should fail type checking, 
% as the rate r1 * r2 is used as a rate then one of
% the two must be a rate. However r3 is used as a
% rate and multiplied to r1 * r2

r1 = 1.0 ;
r2 = 2.0 ;
r3 = 3.0 ;
r4 = r1 * r2 * r3 ;

P1 = (a, r1 * r2).P2 ;
P4 = (a, r4).P2 ;
P2 = (a, r2).P3 ;
P3 = (a, r3).P1 ;



( P1 <> P1 <> P4 )
