% Tests whether or not our detector for unrequired
% actions within a cooperation works.
% Very simple test.
% This should *not* raise an error because P1 does in fact
% perform an 'a' action

r1 = 1.0;
r2 = 2.0;
r3 = 3.0;

% Note that P1 skips over P2 and goes to P3, which goes back to P1
P1 = (a, r1).P3;
P2 = (b, r2).P2;
P3 = (b, r3).P1;

% This one should of course not
( (P1 <a> P1) <b> P2 )
