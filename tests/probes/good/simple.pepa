// Both P and Q may cooperate with a Server to perform an "a,b"
// sequence of actions. Now we want to measure the expected
// response time from a, b, for either P or Q, but not both.
// The simple global model, will incorrectly measure the
// passage of time between the whole model performing an  'a'
// and the whole model performing a 'b'.
// So we therefore have to be more clever about it.
