% Airbag PEPA model for computing response time between airbag
% deployment and dispatch of rescue service.  Process this with
% ipc -s airbag -t finished

% All timings are expressed in minutes. Thus a rate 1.0 means that
% something happens once a minute (on average).  A rate of 6.0 means
% that the associated activity happens six times a minute on average,
% or that its average duration is ten seconds.  All rates included in
% the present example are conjectured.

% We want to evaluate this example over a longer time: up to 15 minutes.

r1 =   0.1 ;  % an airbag deploys occasionally.
r2 =   6.0 ;  % the car can transmit location data in 10 seconds
r3 =   1.0 ;  % it takes one minute to register the incoming data
r4 =   1.0 ;  % it takes one minute to call the driver's phone
r5 =   1.0 ;  % give the driver one minute to answer the phone
p  =   0.7 ;  % 70 per cent chance that the driver will not answer
r6 =   1.0 ;  % take one minute to decide to dispatch medical help

Car1 = (airbag             , r1) . Car2             ;
Car2 = (reportToService    , r2) . Car3             ;
Car3 = (processReport      , r3) . Car4             ;
Car4 = (callDriversPhone   , infty) . Car5          ;
Car5 = (timeoutDriversPhone, p * r5) . Car6
     + (driverAnswersPhone , (1.0 - p) * r5) . Car7 ;

% A bit poor that we have to perform the rescue?
Car6 = (rescue             , infty) . Car7          ;
Car7 = finished . Car1                              ;

Service        = (reportToService    , infty) . ServiceRespond ;
ServiceRespond = (callDriversPhone   , r4)    . ServiceWait    ;
ServiceWait    = (timeoutDriversPhone, infty) . ServiceRescue
               + (driverAnswersPhone , infty) . Service        ;
ServiceRescue  = (rescue             , r6)    . Service        ;
