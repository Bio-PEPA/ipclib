% This file is a test model describing an unreliable machine.
% This is the core pepa version of the file
% unreliable_machine.fr.pepa which uses functional rates to achieve
% the same idea.

computeRate = 0.5 ;
crashRate   = 1 - computeRate ;

paperworkRate = 0.5 ;
rebootRate    = 1 - paperworkRate ;

% The unreliable machine, this is the same in both versions.
MachineUp   = (compute, computeRate).MachineUp + 
	      (crash, crashRate).MachineDown ;
MachineDown = (reboot, infty).MachineUp ;


% Now the user
User        = (compute, infty).User +
              (crash, infty).AngryUser ;
AngryUser   = (paperwork, paperworkRate).AngryUser +
	      (reboot, rebootRate).User ;


% The final composition is straightforward
User <compute, crash, reboot> MachineUp
