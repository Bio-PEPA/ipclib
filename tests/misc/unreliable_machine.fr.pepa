% This file describes the operation of an unreliable machine using
% functional rates. There is a sister file
% unreliable_machine.core.pepa
% which describes the same thing but without the use of functional rates.

computeRate = 0.5 ;
crashRate   = 1 - computeRate ;

paperworkRate = 0.5 ;
rebootRate    = 1 - paperworkRate ;

% The unreliable machine, this is the same in both versions.
MachineUp   = (compute, computeRate).MachineUp + 
	      (crash, crashRate).MachineDown ;
MachineDown = (reboot, infty).MachineUp ;


% Now the user
User        = (compute, infty).User +
              (paperwork, paperworkRate).User +
	      (reboot, if MachineDown then rebootRate else 0.0).User ;

	     


% The final composition is straightforward
User <compute, reboot> MachineUp
