% Okay, one problem when asking a question such as when we see
% an 'a' action how long until we see a 'b' action, is that it
% can be *anyone* who performs the 'b' action.

% So here, we have a process that very regularly starts a 'computation'
% but takes a long time to complete it. We want to see if our results
% are overly good, because we often see an 'end' action shortly after
% a 'start' action, because we see someone completing a computation.

% This file goes with sanity.pepa and shows what the probability is
% when there is just one process, which does not have the problem
% that anyone else can 'complete' your computation.
