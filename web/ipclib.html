    <p>
      This page contains information about "ipclib".
   
      ipclib is a library for working with PEPA models and stochastic probes.  
      Probes allow the modeller to specify a passage of interest through the
      behaviour of the model and, in tandem with ipc/Hydra,
      computing cumulative distribution functions across this passage.
   

      A small paper relating to ipclib is available
      <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s9810217/papers/qest2007acsg.pdf">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A manual for the pepaprobe utility is available
      <a href="../doc/pepaprobe/pepaprobemanual.pdf">here</a>

    Automatically haddock generated documentation is available

      <b>Please note:</b> this is a very experimental version and I would expect
      you to both encounter problems and damage some data.

   <h2>Utilities which use ipclib</h2>
   There are some utilities which come with the ipclib distribution.
        <ul>
           <li>
           pepacheck : A utility which performs the static analysis provided by ipclib on
             the input PEPA models.
          </li>
           <li>
           pepalatex : A utility which outputs the given PEPA model as LaTeX source which may
           then be included in a LaTeX document. Additionally pepalatex may perform
           any number of renamings over rate and process names.
          </li>
           <li>
           pepaprobe : A utility which transforms a PEPA model by adding one or many performance
           specification probes.
           To invoke pepaprobe, a pepa model file is given as an argument and a number of
           probes are given using the <code>--probe</code> option. The arguments to the
           <code>--probe</code> option will in general need to be surrounded by quotes.
           <br>
           <code> pepaprobe --probe probe1 --probe probe2 --probe probe3 model.pepa </code>
           <br>

           The file
            <a href="../tests/probes/good/clientServer.pepa">clientServer.pepa
            </a>
           contains a pepa model of a group of clients cooperating with a group of servers.
           
           These can be analysed with a variety of probes such as:
               <ul>
                 <li><code>
                  "ClientIdle request:clientReq, response:clientResp"
                 </code></li>
                 <li><code>
                  "ServerIdle break:serverBreak, repair:serverRepair"
                 </code></li>
                 <li><code>
                 "(serverBreak, clientReq:start)/serverRepair, clientResp:stop"
                 </code></li>
               </ul>
          <p>
          The first of these probes attaches itself to a <code>ClientIdle</code> process.
          Notice that the only such processes are within a process array hence
          <code>pepaprobe</code> will split up the array so that a single
          <code>ClientIdle</code> process can be monitored. The probe waits for a
          <code>request</code> action and sends a <code>clientReq</code> communication signal
          upon observing one. Once this has happened the probe will wait for a
          <code>response</code> action and send a <code>clientResp</code> signal.
          If the probe observes one action while waiting for the other no communication signal
          is sent.
          </p>

          <p>
          The second probe is very similar except that it is attached to a 
          <code>ServerIdle</code> process.
          The actions it is concerned with are the <code>break</code> and
          <code>repair</code> actions.
          </p>

          <p>
          Finally a master probe is defined which is not localised to any process but is
          combined with the entire model, including those probes added before it. The master
          probe simply waits for the communication signals to be sent from the localised probes.
          The probe waits for a <code>serverBreak</code> signal followed by a
          <code>clientReq</code> signal. In between these two signals if the probe observes a
          <code>serverRepair</code> signal then the probe is reset into its original state.
          In this way the probe only ever sends a <code>start</code> signal if a client makes
          a request while (at least) one of the servers is broken. After sending a
          <code>start</code> signal the probe waits for a <code>clientResp</code> signal and
          when recieved sends a <code>stop</code> signal.
          </p>

          <p>
          In this way the master probe will send start and stop signals to indicate the passage
          from a client's request to that request being serviced, but only if the request was
          made when at least one of the servers was broken.
          </p>

          Some probes can become quite complicated and it comes helpful to store them in
          files. The <code>pepaprobe</code> utility therefore accepts an argument
          <code>--argfile file</code> which specifies a file in which command line arguments
          can be kept. Hence the above 
            <a href="../tests/probes/good/clientServer.pepa">clientServer.pepa
            </a> file can be used with the
            <a href="../tests/probes/good/clientServer.args">clientServer.args
            </a> file with the command-line:<br>
            <code>pepaprobe --argfile clientServer.args</code>
         
          </li>
       </ul>

    <h2>Obtaining ipclib and related utilities</h2>
    <h3>Precompiled Linux Binaries</h3>
      There are three utility programs created with ipclib.
      Pre-compiled binaries of these programs may be downloaded here:
        <ul>
           <li>
           <a href="pepacheck">
           pepacheck
           </a>
           : A utility which performs the static analysis provided by ipclib on
             the input PEPA models.
          </li>
           <li>
           <a href="pepalatex">
           pepalatex
           </a>
           : A utility which outputs the given PEPA model as LaTeX source which may
           then be included in a LaTeX document. Additionally pepalatex may perform
           any number of renamings over rate and process names.
          </li>
           <li>
           <a href="pepaprobe">
           pepaprobe 
           </a>
           : A utility which transforms a PEPA model by adding one or many performance
           specification probes.
          </li>
       </ul>
    <h3>Darcs</h3>
    The source for ipclib can be downloaded via darcs by giving the command:<br>
    <code>&nbsp;darcs get --partial http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s9810217/software/ipclib/</code><br>
    <h3>A Source tarball</h3>
    The source is also available in a compressed tar file:
       <a href = "../ipclib.tar.gz">
       ipclib.tar.gz
       </a>
   <h3>Compiling the Source</h3>
   To compile the source, the
   <a href = "http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s9810217/software/hatexlib.tar.gz">
    hatexlib.tar.gz
   </a>
   library is required. Assuming the reader is now in a directory with two sub-directories
   <code>hatexlib</code> and <code>ipclib</code> corresponding to the uncompressed source
   directories, the code for ipclib can be compiled with the following commands:<br>
   <code>
cd hatexlib<br>
runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user --prefix=dirname<br>
runhaskell Setup.hs build<br>
runhaskell Setup.hs install<br>
cd ../ipclib<br>
runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user --prefix=dirname<br>
runhaskell Setup.hs build<br>
runhaskell Setup.hs install<br>
   </code>
The name <code>dirname</code> should be set to some suitable location within your path.
Both options to the configure commands may be omitted if installing as root.
