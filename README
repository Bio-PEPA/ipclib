This is the source code for the International PEPA Compiler (library).
This was initially started at Imperial College by Jeremy Bradley and named
the Imperial PEPA Compiler. After development was mostly done at Edinburgh
it was re-named the International PEPA Compiler. Some refactoring allowed
most of the functionality to be available as a library.

To install it you will need to set up the Haskell compiler (ghc) and the
distribution mechanism known as "cabal".

Note there is further documentation in the 'doc' directory.
