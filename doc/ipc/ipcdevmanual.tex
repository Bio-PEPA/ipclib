\section*{About this document \ldots}

This document is a manual for users of the International \pepa\ Compiler
or \ipc. Users are expected to already know how to interpret their
models. A companion document, ``The ipc tutorial'' is available.
The tutorial explains how to use \pepa\cite{pepa} for stochastic modelling
in addition to using \ipc\ in order to solve \pepa\ models.

This is the developers addition of this manual and as such contains
details of the implementation of \ipc\ which may be useful those wishing
to use the library interface. However such details may of course be
unnecessary for users simply wishing to use \ipc\ to analyse their
\pepa\ models.
