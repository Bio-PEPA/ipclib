\section*{About this document \ldots}

This document is a manual for users of the International \pepa\ Compiler
or \ipc. Users are expected to already know how to interpret their
models. A companion document, ``The ipc tutorial'' is available.
The tutorial explains how to use \pepa\cite{pepa} for stochastic modelling
in addition to using \ipc\ in order to solve \pepa\ models.
